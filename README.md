Sentiment Analysis on Text Data This repository contains a Sentiment Analysis project that classifies text into three sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. 

The project utilizes various techniques such as TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, and N-grams to convert text data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.
Features: Data Preprocessing: Text data is cleaned, tokenized, and vectorized using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings. 
Sentiment Classification: Machine learning models are trained on the processed data to classify sentiments. 
Visualizations: Sentiment distribution is visualized using countplots, helping to understand sentiment trends in the dataset. 
Feature Engineering: Key features like word frequency, document length, and punctuation usage are extracted to improve model accuracy. 
Project Structure: Data Folder: Contains raw and cleaned datasets. 
Notebooks Folder: Jupyter notebooks with data analysis, visualizations, and model training. Scripts Folder: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model building. 
Images Folder: Visualizations generated during analysis. requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries to run the project. 

Goal: The primary goal of this project is to classify text into sentiment categories, providing valuable insights that could be used for business intelligence, customer feedback analysis, or social media sentiment tracking.
